# Introduction

In this project, we've developed a billing system tailored for store management, empowering store staff to efficiently handle transactions and manage orders. The system is built using React and utilizes Ant Design as the CSS framework for styling.

With a focus on modularity and scalability, the CSS is organized using CSS modules, ensuring better maintainability and encapsulation of styles. This allows for cleaner and more manageable code, reducing the risk of style conflicts and improving overall code quality.

By leveraging the power of React and Ant Design, we've aimed to create a visually appealing and user-friendly interface, providing a seamless experience for both store staff and customers.
